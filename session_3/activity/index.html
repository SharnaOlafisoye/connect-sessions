    <!-- 1. Add a div (<div></div>) element inside the section (<section>) element and give that div an "id" of "card" , you should then see a card on the screen -->
    <!-- 2. Inside the div (<div>) element you created add a paragraph (<p></p>) element -->
    <!-- 3. Inside  the paragraph (<p>) you just created add the text - The 4 Suits of playing cards as it's content -->
    <!-- 4. After the paragraph (<p>) element, but still inside the div (<div>) element, add an unordered (<ul>) or ordered (<ol>) list and then place 4 list-items (<li></li>) elements inside of that list -->
    <!-- 5. Set the content for each list item (<li>) to be one of the suit codes (use all 4, one for each li): &spades; - &hearts; - &clubs; - &diams; -->
    <!-- 6. Add a class of "red" or "black" to the list item (<li>) to make the suit icon appear as that color, once this is done move to number 7 on line 19 of the CSS tab -->
