    <!-- find the CSS rule for the suit "class" in the CSS tab and change it's color value -->
    <!-- find the CSS rule for the number "class" in the CSS tab and change it's color value -->
    <!-- find the CSS rule for the center-suit "id" in the CSS tab and change it's color value -->
     <!-- QUESTION: If we were to duplicate this code to create another card on this page, would there be any issues related to that? If so, why?-->
    <!-- BONUS ACTIVITY: Add a transform to the card "class" to turn the card, reference link is here https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_transform -->
    <!-- BONUS QUESTION: Why do you think the CSS rules for the classes 'number' and 'suit' are not nested? -->
    <!-- BONUS ACTIVITY: You can change the suit of the card using a different symbol to make it your own.  Reference link here for symbols: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_symbols.asp and this reference link for emojis: https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_emojis.asp -->
