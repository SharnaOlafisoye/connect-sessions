    <!-- The purpose of this activity is to get use comfortable with the basic structure of HTML elements -->
    <!-- nest some div elements inside the section element, however many you like -->
    <!-- make sure the div tags have both the opening and closing tag -->
    <!-- EXTRA CREDIT: Inside the div tags you can nest a p tag and add an emoji or symbol to it to make the card moreinteresting -->
    <!-- do not nest the div tags inside other div tags -->
    <!-- HINT: If you see a red card you nested the <div> inside another div -->
    <!-- HINT: Copy and paste can help you add more cards more quickly -->
    <!-- NOTE: The cards may appear tilted, you are doing it right if you see that, I jstu wanted it to look more interesting as you went on, if you have done any CSS, can you see in the CSS file how I achieve that? -->
