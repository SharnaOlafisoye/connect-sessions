      <!-- nest a div tag inside the section tag, you will seee the card pop up -->
      <!-- then nest 3 more div tags inside that parent div, you will not see a change on the screen for this one just yet -->
      <!-- inside your first nested div tag nest 2 p tags, you should see a number and a suite added to the card (this is random and will change again) -->
      <!-- inside the second nested div tag nest 1 p tag, should see a suite in the middle of the card, all will change -->
      <!-- inside the third nested div tag nest a span tag, card will change again but nothing new shows yet -->
      <!-- inside that span tag nest 2 p tags, should see card number and suite in bottom right, card will be mismatched -->
      <!-- when that is finished you should see a playing card, the numbers and colors will be totally random -->
      <!-- BONUS QUESTION: Can you tell me which one of these elements is an "inline" element? Feel free to put it into the chat -->
      <!-- keep nested content after this line (just create more space between the two lines by hitting return) -->




      <!-- keep nested content above this line -->
